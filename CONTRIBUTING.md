# Contributing

Contributions are welcome - code, docs, whatever it might be! If this is your first contribution to an Open Source project or you're a core maintainer of multiple projects, your time and interest in contributing to this project is most welcome.

## Write code with others

This is an open source project, with an open and welcoming community that is always keen to welcome new contributors. We recommend the two best ways to interact with the community are:

- **GitHub issues**: To discuss more slowly, or longer-written messages.
- **[Discord chat](https://discord.postiz.com)**: To chat with people [Discord chat](https://discord.postiz.com/) and a quicker feedback.

As a general rule;

- **If a change is less than 3 lines**: You're probably safe just to submit the change without a discussion. This includes typos, dependency changes, and quick fixes, etc.
- **If a change is more than 3 lines**: It's probably best to discuss the change in an issue or on discord first. This is simply because you might not be aware of the roadmap for the project, or understand the impact this change might have. We're just trying to save you time here, and importantly, avoid you being disappointed if your change isn't accepted.
