## Intro

<strong>Become a content machine</strong> - you might have heard it before; if you want to promote your stuff, you must release content.

To become consistent with your content, you have to set up everything before and take 1-2 weeks of a buffer (at least) so you can launch your stuff.

You want to be relaxed about the following content and not to make split-second mistakes.

Today, for open-source tools, that's impossible.<br /><br />

<h3>Why?</h3>

Because you must do everything manually, even existing scheduling tools let you schedule only Social Media posts (and ignore essential platforms such as Reddit).

But how can you make your social media post if you still need to release your article?

How do you release all your articles at the same time - without copy-pasting them between platforms?

How do you know when is the best time to post?

That's where Gitroom shines; you can do all of it beforehand.
