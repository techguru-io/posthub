Postiz uses Resend to send email notifications to users. Emails are currently 
required as part of the new-user creation process, which sends an activation 
email.

* Register to [Resend](https://resend.com), and connect your domain.
* Copy your API Key from the Resend control panel.
* Open the .env file and edit the following line.

```env
RESEND_API_KEY="<your-api-key-here>"
```

Feel free to contribute other providers to send email notifications.
