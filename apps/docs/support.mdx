Sometimes, things can go wrong, or you need some help!

Note that the Self Hosted version of Postiz is supported by the community in their
free time, on a best-efforts basis. Please post your question and be patient.

- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sf7QjTcX37) - Flexible chat, with screenshots and screen sharing, probably the best option for support.
- [GitHub issue](https://github.com/gitroomhq/postiz-app/issues/new/choose) - backup option if you are unable to use Discord.

## How to effectively ask for support

Try to follow this guide when asking for support, in this order; **Goal, Environment, Changes, Results**.

- **Goal:** Start off by explaining what you were trying to do
  - _I want to schedule a post on Reddit at 6pm_
  - _I want to run in a Linux container on a Raspberry Pi_
  - _I want to use a custom domain name_

- **Environment:** - Share the relevant parts about your environment. Web App issues; Are you using Firefox, Chrome, etc? Installation/Other issues; a Mac, Linux, Windows, how did you install?
  - _I'm using Firefox on Windows 10_
  - _I'm using a Raspberry Pi 4 with Ubuntu 20.04, and Node version 18_
  - _This is a new installation on a Mac_

- **Changed:** - Most likely something has changed, what is it?
  - _I updated my browser to the latest version and now ..._
  - _I found a change in the latest version and now ..._
  - _I think this used to work, but now..._

- **Results:** - What happened? What did you expect to happen?
  - _I see a blank screen_
  - _I see an error message_
  - _I see a 404 page_
