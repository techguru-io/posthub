At the moment it is necessary to build the project locally - some dependencies 
like redis and postgres can run as docker containers, but there is no docker 
container for Postiz just yet.

## Self Hosted installation options

You can choose between the following installation options;

* [Development](/installation/development) - The only installation option that is offically supported at the moment.
* [Docker (standalone)](/installation/docker) - Run from the command line with Docker.
* [Docker Compose](/installation/docker-compose) - Run with Docker Compose.
* [Helm](/installation/kubernetes-helm) - Run with Kubernetes + Helm.
