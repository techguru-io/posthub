## Controlling container services
The environment variable POSTIZ_APPS defaults to "", which means that all
services will be started in a single container. However, you can only start 
specific services within the docker container by changing this environement variable.

For most deployments, starting all services is fine. To scale out, you might want
to start individual containers for "frontend", "backend", "worker" and "cron".
