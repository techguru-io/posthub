## What is crosspublic?

crosspublic is a tool to convert private communication into public knowledge.<br />
Most of your users are not on your communication channels, and they are not aware of the questions that have already been asked and answered.<br />

## Architecture
crosspublic is an [NX monorepo](https://nx.dev) that contains the backend, control panel, discord bot, marketing website and the docs.<br /><br />
Unlike other NX project, this project has one `.env` file that is shared between all the apps.<br />
It makes it easier to develop and deploy the project.<br /><br />
When deploying to websites like [Railway](https://railway.app) or [Heroku](https://heroku.com), you can use a shared environment variables for all the apps.<br />

**It has four main components:**
- `Panel` - NextJS control panel to manage your FAQ, it also contains the public website of every user FAQ page.
- `Tenants` - NextJS website that contains the FAQ of every end-user.
- `Backend` - NestJS that operate as the server for both the bots and the website.
- `Discord` - Discord bot that listen to messages, and send them to the backend.

In the future there will also be a bot of Slack, Intercom, Telegram, and more.
