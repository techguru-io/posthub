<Note>
  The Public API is only available for the PRO plan and the self-hosted plan.

## Why public API
if you want to build a custom implementation of the FAQ page, or you want to use it in different service, you can use the public API to get the data.

## How to use the public API
There are two main options to use the Public API:
1. For the **PRO plan**, go to [Settings](https://app.crosspublic.com/dashboard/settings) and copy the API key.<br />
For every request to the `/public` API URL send a header called `apikey` with the value of the API key.

2. For the **self-hosted plan**, you can also pass `serverkey` to bypass package check.<br />
The `serverkey` is the value of `BACKEND_TOKEN_PROTECTOR` in the `.env` file.

Check the endpoints on the left for API reference.
